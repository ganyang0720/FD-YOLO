# FD-YOLO
This is an improved model based on YOLOv10, designed for face mask detection in complex scenarios.

## CODE：
You can get the official  YOLOv10 code at https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics

and then add our improvement code to the project.

We have released all the improved code, and the code in project format is still being organized.
